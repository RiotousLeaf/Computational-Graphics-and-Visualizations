# Computational-Graphics-and-Visualizations

Using a preselected image, this code creates a 3D objects that represent the components and layout of that image and responds to input devices

I was able to generate a failry accurate representations of three-dimensional objects using application programming interface libraries and computer graphics development best practices. Using an iterative design process I created th scence by starting with a simple pyramid, then adding textures, lighting and building out more complex objects over time. This iterative process is common in software devlopment and allows for cleaner code with fewer errors. 

This project was my first using C++ and OpenGL and I gained valuable experience in setting up a development environment using these libraries. In the process I learned best practices for creating project templates and transferring pre-exisitng environments into new projects. The iterative approach was ideal in learning about how vertex and shader data is transferred to the GPU before adding complexity and texture/lighting data. 

The knowledge of computational graphics and visualizations gained throughout this was very insightful and gave me a better understantding of data structures used in rendering images and the the inner workings of interfaces like Blender. Though I'm not sure if the information will be directly yseful to me in my future education and career paths but the best practices in coding, development environment, and syntax will definitely be applicable in future projects.
